# 🔐 Chashini: Secure Retail Data Collaboration using Confidential Computing

**Chashini** is a proof-of-concept (PoC) platform designed to enable **secure, privacy-preserving data collaboration and analytics for the retail industry**, powered by **Confidential Computing (CC)**. It allows multiple retailers to perform joint analysis on encrypted datasets without exposing raw data — even during computation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional encryption protects data at rest and in transit but fails during **active processing**, leaving data vulnerable. **Chashini** solves this using **hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** to keep data encrypted **even while being processed** — enabling zero-trust, collaborative analytics across organizations.

## 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ **Secure Data Ingestion** — Encrypted retail data is loaded directly into isolated TEEs.
- 🔍 **Privacy-Preserving Analytics** — Supports analytics like fraud detection, customer segmentation, and joint trend analysis within TEEs.
- 🛡️ **Hardware-Enforced Privacy** — Uses Intel SGX, AMD SEV/TDX, or Arm CCA for secure enclaves.
- 🔐 **Attestation & Trust Verification** — Ensures execution in genuine, untampered environments.
- 🤝 **Multi-Party Collaboration** — Enables multiple retailers to run joint analytics without exposing individual datasets.
- 📊 **Tool Compatibility** — Compatible with Python, NumPy, Pandas, Spark, and other popular analytics tools.
- 📜 **Regulatory Compliance** — Helps meet GDPR, CCPA, and India’s DPDP Act requirements with cryptographic guarantees.
- 💡 **Protection of Business Logic** — Proprietary algorithms remain confidential, even from the host/cloud provider.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**  
   Each retailer encrypts sensitive datasets (e.g., customer IDs, transactions) using shared or public-key encryption.

2. **Launch Trusted Execution Environment**  
   A confidential VM or enclave is provisioned and attested for integrity verification.

3. **Secure Data Ingestion**  
   Decryption keys are securely provisioned, and data is decrypted only within the TEE.

4. **Run Analytics in TEE**  
   Analytical models or queries are executed within the secure enclave with strict controls.

5. **Secure Output Generation**  
   Only anonymized, aggregated, or re-encrypted results are exported — signed by the enclave's attestation key.

6. **Verification & Retrieval**  
   Participants verify the attestation report and retrieve the secure, trusted result.
